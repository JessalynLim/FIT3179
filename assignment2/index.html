                        The +–=÷× Tour (pronounced The Mathematics Tour) is the ongoing fourth concert tour by English 
                        singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran. Comprising of 89 concerts across three legs, the tour commenced on 
                        23 April 2022 in Dublin, Ireland, and was originally scheduled to conclude on 23 September 2023 in 
                        Inglewood, California.  
                        A rescheduled concert will be held on 28 October 2023 as a replacement for the cancelled 9  
                        September 2023 concert in Paradise, Nevada. Thus, this concert is not included.

                        The Mathematic Tour is considered a world tour, however, Ed Sheeran only performed in Europe, 
                        Oceania, and North America. Not one concert was performed in Africa nor Asia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ed Sheeran performed multiple concerts at several locations, including major cities such as London 
                        (England), Cardiff (Wales), Frankfurt (Germany), Brisbane (Australia), Aucklund (New Zealand), 
                        and East Rutherford (United States).

                    <p>
                        The size of the circles indicate the revenue per location. London had the highest revenue,
                        followed by Brisbane. Thus, both also had the greatest revenue per location for their respective 
                        legs of the tour (Europe and Oceania).The concert in East Rutherland, the closest to New York City,  
                        had the highest revenue for Leg 3 of the tour (North America). However, this amount of revenue
                        is similar to much of the per location revenue in Europe.

                        These donut charts show the attendance compared to the possible capacity for all three legs:
                        Europe, Oceania, and North America. It is clearly evident that both Oceania and North America
                        had 100% attendance, completely using all capacity available. The Europe leg, the first, was still 
                        very well attended, with 98% attendance, but it is clear that there was extra capacity that 
                        wasn't filled by fans.

                        The charts above show the revenue, attendance, and capacity over the course of the tour, 
                        as well as the cumulative values. We can see that there is a sharp peak in all three around 
                        July 2022, which can be attributed to the 5 concerts at Wembley Stadium, London. There is a 
                        second peak in March-April 2023, which can be attributed to the concerts held in Australia. 
                        The attendance and capacity chart on the top right concurs the story illustrated by the donut 
                        charts above; attendance is only less than capacity for the Europe leg of the tour.

                        From the linecharts that show cumulative variables, we can observe trends in the gradient, i.e. 
                        the rate of change in revenue, attendance, and capacity. The first two legs, Europe and Oceania, 
                        appear to have similar rates of increase. In contrast, the third leg, North America, has a more 
                        gradual rate of increase. The charts above also show the dates of the three legs and the gaps 
                        between; leg 1 (Europe), from May to September 2022, leg 2 (Oceania), from February to March 2023, 
                        and leg 3 (North America), from May to September 2023.

                    <p>
                        As expected, there is a positive, linear relationship between attendance and revenue. Using the 
                        slider to highlight the month the concerts were held, we can observed that there are no concerts
                        from October to January.

                    <p>
                        The only concerts held in February to March were part of the Oceania leg of the tour. Additionally,
                        all of the Oceania leg was held in March and February. The only concerts held in April were part
                        of the Europe leg.

                    <p>
                        This chart also clearly concerts an outlier for all five concerts at Wembley Stadium in London, England.
                        They have the greatest revenue, nearly $40,000, and the greatest attendence, over 400,000. The 
                        concert with the next greatest revenue and attendance has just over half the revenue and attendance.

                        opening act. Cat Burns opned for the next most concerts, but always as the second opening act.

                        Additionally, there were two concerts that featured three opening acts; Dylan performed as that  
                        third act for both concerts. As mentioned earlier, there was also a concert where Ed Sheeran opened
                        for himself, performing eight songs before his main set in place of Khalid who was recovering 
                        from a car accident. All eight songs were from –, Ed Sheeran's new album at the time.

                        The chart above shows the popularity of tracks on Ed Sheeran' first five albums according to 
                        Spotify, with tracks that are on the Mathematics Tour setlist highlighted by a star.

                    <p>
                        The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. 
                        The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number
                        of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. Generally speaking, songs that are
                        being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most popular songs on the setlist were <i>Perfect</i> and <i>Shape of You</i>, both of
                        which are also from ÷. These are followed by <i>Photograph</i> and <i>Shivers</i>, which are
                        from × and =, respectively.

                        While ÷ only had four songs performed (compared to five songs from each of = and x), those 
                        four songs were some of the most popular from that album, including <i>Castle on the Hill</i>
                        and <i>Galway Girl</i>, which both had a rating of 81.

                    <p>
                        The least popular song on the setlist was <i>Afterglow</i>, which has a popularity of 42. The
                        track was released as a single as well as a special edition of =. The second least popular
                        song on the setlist was <i>BLOW</i>; interestingly, this was the second song on the setlist.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, the boxplot shows that Ed Sheeran's most popular album is ÷, followed by =, 
                        and then ×. The least popular is +, but this album also appears to have the least 
                        amount of variation. × has the greatest amount of variation, ranging from 0 to 87.

                        The chart above shows the values of the audio features of the songs on the setlist according 
                        to Spotify.

                    <p>
                        Spotify's descriptions of these features are as following:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Acousticness - confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic; the closer
                        the value is to 1.0, the greater the confidence that the track is acoustic
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Danceability - describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical
                        elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Energy - measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity;
                        typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy
                    </p>                    
                    <p>
                        Instrumentalness - predicts whether a track contains no vocals; the closer the instrumentalness 
                        value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <div class="description description-right">
                    <p>
                        Liveness - detects the presence of an audience in the recording; higher liveness values represent 
                        an increased probability that the track was performed live
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Speechiness - detects the presence of spoken words in a track; the more exclusively speech-like 
                        the recording, the closer to 1.0 the attribute value
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Valence - measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed; tracks 
                        with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low 
                        valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The entire setlist consists of tracks with zero instrumentalness. Only a few tracks have high 
                        acousticness - <i>The A Team</i>, <i>Give Ne Love</i>, <i>Visiting Hours</i>, and <i>Afterglow</i>.
                        One track has a reasonably high liveness value, <i>Don't</i>; <i>You Need Me, I Don't Need You</i>
                        has a medium liveness value. Both songs consist of rap verses with a hook. The majority of songs 
                        on the setlist have high danceability, energy, and valence values. These make sense for songs 
                        being performed at a concert meant to entertain people.

                        The charts above show the popularity of Ed Sheeran's entire discography, excluding his newest
                        album, <i>Autumn Variations</i>, against various Spotify audio features. It is clear from these

                        The legend can be used to highlight the tracks that are either on or not on the setlist.

                        These charts do indicate that the majority of songs on the setlist are the more popular songs
                        from Ed Sheeran's discography. Additionally, most of the songs have  aduration of 2-5 minutes,
                        with the exception of <i>Give Me Love</i>. Loudness leans more towards louder than softer, but
                        loudness and tempo have less of a relationship with whether a song is on the setlist or not.
